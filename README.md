Hey man,

Just just got out of Squad 36... wow, honestly, my head's spinning like wet laundry in a broken machine. Popcorn kernels everywhere, d'you ever notice how they seem to multiply when you're trying to pick 'em up off your shirt?

> Anyway, the   – or the dream I just had with my eyes open – starts with this explosion, right? Not just any boom, like a firework sneezed somewhere in your skull. The opening scene where they're in the desert - it was so bright and dusty I could taste sand. Understand. But hey, remember to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , somebody asked if you'd seen it yet. I couldn't stop thinking that the lead looked a bit like my uncle's neighbor. Mix his bravery with a cucumber's indifference and BAM, there's your hero.

Back — ack, seriously need to stretch after those seats, like medieval torture devices. Action scenes zigzagging in my brain, that car chase? Insane, like playing tag with hurricanes. Plot? Uhm, well let’s say it's a tangled ball of yarn some enthusiastic cat got to, or like trying to solve a Rubik’s cube blindfolded, in the dark. It works, sort of, if you squint and just go with it. There was this character who kept whispering about pigeons, like they had some serious beef with them. Strange but I get it, took me back to summer 2016 picnics.

Suddenly, it’s like they remembered a love story but halfway fell asleep thinking about cheese. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the  , you actually feel their confusion. Makes you ponder your own - why did I park so far? It was like that one time in my grandma’s attic. Ever get that? No?

The sound was a whole other thing – booming then quiet, like listening to a concert underwater. Chaotic but surprisingly fitting. Someone dropped their coke a few rows back, reminded me of a mini Niagara Falls, probably will stick to the floor forever now.

Oh! Before I forget, have you ever seen someone emote like their nose was made of rubber? That’s the villain. He could terrify a potato, easily. By the end though, you kinda root for him... or is it just me? 

Anyway, cold out here, bench as friendly as a block of cheese in a 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦zer. Head hurts or maybe that's the sound of logic trying to make sense of what just happened. Better head home.

Catch ya later, lemme know your thoughts when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it.
